Coffee Shop Web Application Overview
Relevant source files
Purpose and Scope
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the coffee shop web application, a client-side e-commerce interface that enables users to browse coffee products and manage a shopping cart. The application demonstrates modern web development practices using vanilla JavaScript, responsive CSS frameworks, and browser-based persistence.

This overview covers the system's architectural design, core components, and data flow patterns. For detailed information about specific subsystems, see Frontend Application Architecture, Styling and Design Framework, and Visual Asset Library.

System Architecture
The coffee shop web application follows a client-side architecture pattern built around three core layers: presentation, logic, and persistence. The system operates entirely within the browser environment without requiring server-side processing.

Core Application Components
The application consists of four primary functional components that work together to deliver the complete user experience:

Component	Primary File	Key Functions	Purpose
User Interface	index.html	Product catalog, navigation, cart display	Presentation and user interaction
Cart Management	app.js	comprarCafe(), eliminarCafe(), vaciarCarrito()	Shopping cart business logic
Visual Design	custom.css	.card, .submenu, #hero styling	Application theming and responsive layout
Data Persistence	app.js	guardarCafeLocalStorage(), leerLocalStorage()	State management and persistence

Technology Stack
The application leverages a progressive CSS framework approach and vanilla JavaScript for maximum compatibility and performance:

Frontend Stack
HTML5: Semantic markup with responsive grid layout using Skeleton CSS classes
CSS Framework: Three-layer approach with normalize.css, skeleton.css, and custom.css
JavaScript: Vanilla ES5 with DOM manipulation and localStorage integration
Browser APIs: localStorage for client-side persistence, DOM Events API

Data Flow and Persistence
The application implements a unidirectional data flow pattern with localStorage serving as the persistence layer for shopping cart state:

Shopping Cart Data Model
The cart system manages coffee product objects with the following structure defined in the leerDatosCafe() function:

// Data structure from app.js:24-29
const infoCafe = {
    imagen: cafe.querySelector('img').src,
    titulo: cafe.querySelector('h4').textContent,
    precio: cafe.querySelector('.precio span').textContent,
    id: cafe.querySelector('a').getAttribute('date-id')
}
Persistence Operations
Operation	Function	Purpose
Save Item	guardarCafeLocalStorage()	Add product to cart in localStorage
Load Cart	leerLocalStorage()	Restore cart state on page load
Remove Item	eliminarCafeLocalStorage()	Remove specific product from cart
Clear All	vaciarLocalStorage()	Empty entire cart
